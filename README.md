# Automated-Graphics-Generator
## Inspiration
Since April 2020, I have found myself repeatedly creating the same advertisement with slightly different text, which was both time-consuming and costly. The hackathon presented an ideal opportunity to develop an efficient program that could save time and money for the organization.

## What it does
Automated Graphics Generator allows users to select a .txt file through the GUI, confirm their intent to create and implement graphics, and watch the program create the advertisements almost instantly.

## How it was built
The first goal was to read data from the .txt file and create objects representing individual bands. After that, creating and exporting image files, ensuring that the text on the graphics was properly formatted and aligned, was the primary goal. Thenext challenge was to automate the process of implementing the formats by using the Robot class. After adding error checking to ensure the best algorithmically-determined string format, the graphics were uploaded to the advertising software.

## Challenges run into
The biggest challenge was formatting the text on the graphics, ensuring that it aligned correctly and fit the size of the image. Additionally, developing an algorithm to determine where the text should be split into two lines to fill the space correctly was also a major challenge.

## Accomplishments
Proudly automating the graphics upload process into the advertising software and optimizing it, developing an algorithm to split the text in half to fill the space, and creating a user-friendly GUI.

## Lessons Learned
Through the development of Automated Graphics Generator, I learned how to create a GUI in Java, automate computer processes, and create and export images.

## Future developments
I hope to develop Automated Graphics Generator into a .exe program that reads from a spreadsheet, allowing users to work with more idealized text documents. Another aim is to generalize the program to work with different-sized advertisements and incorporate randomized backgrounds and varying fonts for more attention-grabbing, diverse graphics.
